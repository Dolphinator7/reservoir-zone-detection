# Reservoir Zone Detection and Well Analysis Dashboard

## Overview 
This project focuses on identifying reservoir zones from well log data using Python and Power BI. The goal is to detect potential hydrocarbon-bearing zones and visualize the data through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The project combines data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to generate actionable insights for reservoir evaluation.

Project Highlights Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Performed using Jupyter Notebook and Python.

Reservoir Zone Detection: Created a new column (ReservoirZone) to identify reservoir zones (True/False).

Data Visualization: Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with key charts: Depth vs. Gamma Ray Depth vs. Resistivity Density vs. Porosity

Summary of Reservoir Zones Insights: The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of well data, enabling users to easily identify potential reservoir zones.

Tools and Technologies Python: Data cleaning and preprocessing (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) Jupyter Notebook: Data exploration and manipulation Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation GitHub: Version control and project sharing

Dashboard Visuals Depth vs. Gamma Ray: Helps identify shale and sand formations. Depth vs. Resistivity: Highlights hydrocarbon-bearing zones based on high resistivity values. Density vs. Porosity: Assists in evaluating formation porosity.

How to Use the Dashboard Clone the repository: bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/Dolphinator7/reservoir-zone-detection.git Open the Jupyter Notebook (Reservoir_Analysis.ipynb) to review the data cleaning process. Open the Power BI file (Reservoir_Dashboard.pbix) to explore the interactive dashboard.

Insights and Findings Significant reservoir zones were identified at depths between 1500-2000 meters. High resistivity and porosity values suggest potential hydrocarbon-bearing formations. The dashboard makes it easy to filter data and focus on specific depth ranges or reservoir zones.

Future Improvements Automate reservoir zone detection with machine learning. Integrate more advanced visualizations in Power BI. Apply this workflow to real-world well log data.

Conclusion This project demonstrates how data science and visualization can be used to extract valuable insights from well log data. By combining Python and Power BI, we can effectively detect reservoir zones and communicate results in a user-friendly dashboard.
